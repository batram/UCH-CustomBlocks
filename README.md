# Custom Blocks
This is an `Ultimate Chicken Horse` `BepInEx` mod that adds custom blocks and allows you place pieces in the background.
Currently many new custom blocks are work in progress, so expect things to be broken.

# Background Blocks
Allows you place pieces in the background.
Works with online saves, but background pieces will not appear for users without the mod.
